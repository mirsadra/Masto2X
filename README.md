# Masto2X
A lightweight Python tool that automatically syncs your Mastodon posts to your X (formerly Twitter) account. Supports text, hashtags, and images, so your posts keep their structure and media. Perfect for developers and content creators who want to stay active on both platforms without manual cross-posting.
